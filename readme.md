## ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Luiz!

I'm a passionate Software Engineer actively seeking new opportunities in the cloud computing field, with a strong focus on AWS. My journey in tech has equipped me with hands-on experience in modern web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Svelte.js, Bootstrap, and Tailwind. I thrive on building creative solutions and have developed games like word search and infinite runner, always aiming to deliver engaging user experiences.


My English proficiency is at a B2 level, allowing me to communicate effectively in international environments.

I'm eager to join a team where I can contribute, learn, and grow while working on innovative cloud projects.

If you're looking for someone who is dedicated, curious, and ready to take on new challenges in AWS and cloud development, let's connect!
